This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an incorrect `keyExtractor` function.  The `keyExtractor` function is crucial for FlatList to efficiently update and render its items. If the function doesn't return unique keys for each item, FlatList may produce unexpected behavior, including incorrect rendering and performance issues.  Here's an example of the problem:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }, { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }, { id: 1, name: 'Item 3' }]}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => index} // Incorrect keyExtractor
/>
```

In this case, the `keyExtractor` uses the index, which is not unique since we have duplicate `id` values.  This will lead to unpredictable behavior.  Another common mistake is returning the item itself, as that might not be a primitive type suitable for keys:

```javascript
keyExtractor={(item) => item} // Incorrect, returns object, not primitive
```
